            Solubility is a central protein property and when reduced can lead to diseases. PON-GOF is a prediction
            program to detect amino acid substitutions that increase, decrease or have no effect on the protein
            solubility. The method is based on a gradient boosting algorithm and it has been trained on a large data
            set. The method is fast and has high performance. It can be used to predict variations for proteins from any
            organism.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            PON-GOF was developed in collaboration between the groups of Prof. Mauno Vihinen
            in Lund University
            and
            Assoc. Prof. Yang Yang in Soochow University.
